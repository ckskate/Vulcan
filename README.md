# Vulcan

Vulcan is a modern iOS app for controlling a Storz and Bickel Volcano Hybrid.

## Why the app?

- Since the official app was pulled from the app store (and wasn't very good to
begin with), I set out to create an open source alternative, which wasn't too bad
after the hurdle of reverse-engineering the Volcano's bluetooth comms.
- Since it's a side project, I figured why not mess with the newest stuff, and assuch
such Vulcan is entirely written in SwiftUI, heavily relies on Swift concurrency, and was
made in the Swift Playgrounds app on my iPad (hence the strange packaging).

## Why the name?

- [Vulcan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_(mythology) is the namesake god of volcanos
in Roman mythology, just like how this app makes you the god of your own Volcano.
